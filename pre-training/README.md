# Alphabet Character Recognition Model

## Model Outline

This PyTorch model is designed for optical character recognition and specifically identifies alphabet characters. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with the following key components:

1. **Convolutional Layers:**
   - Layer 1: 2D convolutional layer with 32 filters and a kernel size of 3x3.
   - Layer 2: 2D convolutional layer with 64 filters and a kernel size of 3x3.

2. **Pooling Layers:**
   - Max-pooling layer with a kernel size of 2x2 after each convolutional layer.

3. **Fully Connected Layers:**
   - Layer 1: Fully connected layer with 64 neurons.
   - Layer 2: Output layer with neurons corresponding to the number of alphabet classes.

4. **Activation Function:**
   - Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is applied after each convolutional and fully connected layer.

## Purpose

This model is trained to recognize alphabet characters from images, making it suitable for optical character recognition tasks. The model's primary function is to identify and classify individual alphabets within images, serving as a foundational component for the next stage of the word art Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

## Usage

The model can be trained using the provided script (`train.py`) on a dataset containing alphabet character images. After training, the model checkpoints can be used for further tasks such as fine-tuning, evaluation, or integration into larger projects.

For the next phase of the word art GAN, this character recognition model will play a crucial role in understanding and identifying alphabets within words or phrases.

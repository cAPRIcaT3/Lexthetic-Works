## Overview

Lexthetic Works leverages GANs to create word art that spans different aesthetic styles, including a wide range of aesthetics. The project involves training models to understand typographyand generate word art in diverse and stylized fonts.

## Features

- **Typography Understanding:** OCR model for recognizing and understanding different fonts and characters.
- **Font Prediction:** Model trained to predict missing letters in a given font.
- **Stylized Fonts:** Training on word art and aesthetic-specific fonts for diverse and aesthetically pleasing text generation.
- **Specialized Fonts:** Fine-tuning on very stylized fonts to push the boundaries of creativity.


##Dataset
The dataset used for training comprises various fonts, styles, and aesthetics. Refer to the Dataset section in the codebase for more details on the dataset structure.
